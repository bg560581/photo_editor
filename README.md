This App will have the features of adding photos to a database.

on this site you will have to ability to upload and save your images to a Database.

Express
Mongoose
Axios
Multer
Cors

Technical Information:
to run the app:
    cd into the frontend folder and run npm start
    in a seperate bash, cd into the backend folder and run nodemon

The app will allow you to:
Create posts, 
    images with names
Read the post that you just created
    working on getting the images to be shown
Edit the name of the posts
Deleting the posts 

The app is connected to a Mongo database where all the information will be stored. In order to connect to the database, I have used Axios and to render the images I will be using Multer.

Issues:
I keep running into issues loading the image which I am in the process of fixing

This app is a work in progress and I plan on working on it.

goals for the app:
eventually, I want to be able to open photos in another page or tab. From there I want to be able to edit the image and be able to save the changes to the database. I will start with cropping the image then move onto other customs.
